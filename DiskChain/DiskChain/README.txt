DiskChain

How to open and use the app

The interface of the program represents a simplified model of a total commander.
On the left you can see the local file directory, on the right — the saved file directory.
The buttons in-between them allow you to relocate files from the local drive
to the distributed storage or to copy files from the storage to the local drive.
For now, the network storage is a folder in the C:/
To compile the application, you will need a new Qt Creator. Open the project,
implement the default configuration and compile it. Dependencies are not required.


1.  Summary
DiskChain is a service which aims to solve the problem of limited and paid
storages — it provides its users with infinite storage for their files.
To do this, we have combined the blockchain and torrent technologies:
the former allows us to secure data, while the latter gives our storage placing.
To get access to the infinite storage, the user has to share a section of their
drive with the service. Corporate clients pay for extra backup.

2.  Background
The team emerged a couple of days before the event, the leader is a frontend
and backend developer with an impressive track record and recent experience
in data backup. He came up with the idea when he realized there is no free
distributed storage and the is a possibility to build it using blockchain.


3.  Innovation
Both technologies used are nothing new, but their combination is much fresher.
The revolutionary feature of the storage is being infinite and completely free of charge.
It also allows to store both public and private (accessible for other users) data.

4.  Tools and platforms
Qt Creator: Qt, QML, Java script. Why? It is crossplatform.

5.  Biggest challenge
To integrate the blockchain technology (Etherium).
